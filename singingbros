<p>
I must be gettin' too flashy
</p>
<p>
Y'all shouldn't have let the world gas me (woo)
</p>
<p>
It's too late 'cause I'm here to stay
</p>
<p>
And these girls know that I'm nasty (mm)
</p>
<p>
I sent her back to her boyfriend
</p>
<p>
With my handprint on her ass cheek
</p>
<p>
City talkin', we takin' notes
</p>
<p>
Tell 'em all to keep makin' posts
<p>

</p>
<p>
I don't clear up rumors (ayy)
</p>
<p>
Where's y'all sense of humor? (Ayy)
</p>
<p>
I'm done makin' jokes 'cause they got old like baby boomers
</p>
<p>
Turn my haters to consumers
</p>
<p>
I make vets feel like they juniors (juniors)
</p>
<p>
Say your time is comin' soon but just like Oklahoma (mm)
</p>
<p>
Mine is comin' sooner (mm)
</p>
<p>
I'm just a late bloomer (mm)
</p>
<p>
I didn't peak in high school, I'm still out here gettin' cuter (woo)
</p>
<p>
All these social networks and computers
</p>
<p>
Got these pussies walkin' 'round like they ain't losers (losers)
</p>
<p>
I told you long ago, on the road
</p>
<p>
I got what they waitin' for (I got what they waitin' for)
</p>
<p>
I don't run from nothin', dog
</p>
<p>
Get your soldiers, tell 'em I ain't layin' low
</p>
<p>
(Bitch, I ain't runnin' from no one)
</p>
<p>
You was never really rootin' for me anyway (like, ooh-ooh)
</p>

When I'm back up at the top I wanna hear you say (like, ooh-ooh)
</p>
<p>
He don't run from nothin', dog
